# 🤖 AI Chatbot Mentor  
### Domain-Specific Intelligent Learning Assistant

AI Chatbot Mentor is a **domain-restricted AI mentoring application** built with **Streamlit and LangChain**.  
It provides **focused, module-specific guidance** by answering questions **only within the selected learning domain**, avoiding irrelevant or hallucinated responses.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎯 Module-Based Mentoring  
Users select a learning module and receive guidance limited strictly to that domain.

### 🧠 Strict Domain Control  
Questions outside the selected module are rejected with a fixed response to ensure learning focus.

### 💬 Continuous Chat Experience  
Maintains session-based conversation history.

### 📥 Download Chat History  
Entire chat (user + AI responses) can be downloaded as a `.txt` file for revision or notes.

### 🧼 Simple & Clean UI  
Built using Streamlit’s chat interface for clarity and ease of use.

## ⚠️ Domain Restriction Logic

If a question is unrelated to the selected module, the chatbot responds **exactly** with:

Sorry, I don’t know about this question. Please ask something related to the selected module.

This ensures **accurate, distraction-free mentoring**.
